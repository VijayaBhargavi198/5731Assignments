        " This question is designed to help you understand topic modeling better as well as how to visualize topic modeling results, aims to collect the human meanings of documents. Based on the yelp review data (only the review text will be used for this question), which can be download from Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/s/59hsrk56sfwh9u2/Assignment%20four%20data%20Yelp%20%28question%201%20and%202%29.zip?dl=0, select two models and write a python program to identify the top 20 topics (with 15 words for each topic) in the dataset. Before answering this question, please review the materials in lesson 8, as well as the introduction of these models by the links provided.\n",

        "# **Question 2: Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis**\n",
        " Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining is a sub field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds machine learning algorithms to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains, e.g., positive, negative, neutral. The purpose of this question is to develop a machine learning classifier for sentiment analysis. Based on the dataset from assignment three, write a python program to implement a sentiment classifier and evaluate its performance. Notice: 80% data for training and 20% data for testing.\n",
        " Answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) Features used for sentiment classification and explain why you select these features (tf-idf, sentiment lexicon, word2vec, etc). Considering achieve the best performance as you can.\n",

        "(2) Select two of the supervised learning algorithm from scikit-learn library: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning, to build a sentiment classifier respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) Compare the performance over accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the two algorithms you selected. Here is the reference of how to calculate these metrics: https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9.|"
